# A/B Test: Conversion Rate Optimization

This project focuses on designing and analyzing an A/B experiment to improve website conversion rate.  
It includes:

- Classical A/B testing  
- CUPED variance reduction  
- Bayesian A/B testing  
- Experiment simulation  
- Visualization and statistical interpretation  

The goal is to measure whether a new design/version of a website leads to an improvement in conversion rate.
